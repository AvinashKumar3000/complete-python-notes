## python 2 vs python 3

python 2.x has keywords where `print` is a keyword.

- Hence as `print` is a keyword in python, we are able to use without any `()`.
- In python 3, print has been changed to build in function. Hence we must have to use `()` in `print`.

```python
# python 2
# in python 2, by default it will return int
>>> 22/7
3
# python 3
# here it will be in float
>>> 22/7
3.142857142857143
```

floor division `//`

- python floor division will be rounded towards -ve side.

```python
>>> 5//2
2
>>> 5.0//2
2.0
>>> 5//2.0
2.0
>>> 5//-2.0
-3.0
```
