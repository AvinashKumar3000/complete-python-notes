## list of operators

- =
  - a,b = 1,2
- arithmetic operator
- unary +, unary - : it is called unary +, - because it has only one operand.
- +,- ( addition and subtraction )
- *, / ( divition ), // ( floor division ), % ( modulus )
  - `2+3+5`
  - `2+3*5`
- **

### `most use cases of modulus`

- get remaining values
  - in 100 seconds , we can say 1 minutes and remaining  40 seconds there.
  - how to get this 40 remaining seconds.
  - `100//60` -> 1
  - `100%60`  -> 40
- get last digit

```python
>>> 1234 % 10  # 4
>>> 1234 // 10 # 123
>>> 123 % 10   # 3
>>> 123 // 10  # 12
>>> 12 % 10    # 2
```

- repeat an index value within its limit

```python
>>> li = [ 10, 20, 30 ]
>>> n = len(li) # 3
>>> i = 0
>>> li[ i%n ] # 0%3
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 1%3
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 2%3
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 3%3
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 4%3
>>> i = i + 1
```

🙀 EXTRA : 🙀

```python
>>> a = 5%2 # 
>>> a = -5%2 # 
>>> a = 5%-2 # 
>>> a = -5%-2 # 
```

### `Exponent operator ( ** )`

- usage is purely on maths.
- find square root and cube root

```python
>>> 2**3   #
>>> 2**1   #
>>> 2**-1  #
>>> 2**0.5 # 
```

```python
# other examples
>>> 4**2
>>> 5*4**2
>>> -3**2
>>> (-3)**2
>>> 4**0.5
>>> 4**-0.5
>>> 4**-2

```

`usage`

- square root
- cube root
  - math.ceil
  - math.floor

---
🙀 EXTRA : 🙀

```python
>>>  -3**2
```

- why not `//` for comments
